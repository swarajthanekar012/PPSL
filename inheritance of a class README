This project demonstrates the concept of class inheritance in C++. It includes a base class Parent and a derived class Child, showcasing how members and methods can be inherited and utilized in derived classes.

Features
Base Class: Parent contains a member variable and a method to print its ID.
Derived Class: Child inherits from Parent and adds its own member variable and method.
Encapsulation: Demonstrates encapsulation by using private member variables and constructors.
Code Structure
main.cpp: Contains the implementation of the Parent and Child classes, as well as the main() function that demonstrates theirÂ functionality.
