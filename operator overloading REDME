This project demonstrates the concept of operator overloading in C++.
It features a custom class Count that overloads the increment operator (++) to manipulate a private member variable representing a count. Both prefix and postfix increment operators are implemented.

Features
Class Definition: The Count class encapsulates a private integer value.
Constructor: Initializes value to 5.
Operator Overloading:
Prefix increment (++count): Increases the count by 1.
Postfix increment (count++): Also increases the count by 1 but returns the previous value.
Display Method: Outputs the current value of the count.
Code Structure
main.cpp: Contains the implementation of the Count class, operator overloads, and the main() function that tests theÂ functionality.
